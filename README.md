Submission for parts 1-7

For project 2 validation. Best opened in IntelliJ Idea.

All user input is read via Scanner instead of System.console.readLine(). 
This is because Intellij's debugging console cannot interface with System.console.
To remedy this issue and confidentially read password, simply comment out the
Scanner lines and uncomment the System.console.readLine() lines.

Would've liked to use Generics somewhere but the opportunity didn't present itself.
Reflection could've been fun, too.
